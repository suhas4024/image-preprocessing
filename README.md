Exp1a:- Image Resizing-Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image.
Exp1b:- Image Rotation-Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor.
Exp1c:- Image Translation - Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axi
Exp1d:- Image shearing - Image shearing is a geometric transformation that skews an image along one or both axes i.e x or y axis.
Exp1e:- Image Normalization - Image normalization is a process of scaling the pixel values in an image to a specific range
Exp1f:- Edge detection of Image - The process of image edge detection involves detecting sharp edges in the image.
Exp1g:- Image Blurring - Image blurring is the technique of reducing the detail of an image by averaging the pixel values in the neighborhood.
Exp1h:- Morphological Image Processing - Morphological image processing is a set of python image processing techniques based on the geometry of objects in an image
